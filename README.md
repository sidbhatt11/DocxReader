Current Features :

I will start working on this script once my exams get over in May 2014. If you can't wait till then and if you are a developer, just start working ! I will be glad !

Why did I develop this script ?

I was bored in the class and had two project submissions pending. So I made this script in less than an hour and used the same for both the submissions. :-D 

What did I do ?

I combined some of my custom code with an open-source login script from http://php-login.net
